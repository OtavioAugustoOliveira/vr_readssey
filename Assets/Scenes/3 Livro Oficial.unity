    the Rabbit-Hole</color></size></align>\r\n\r\n  Alice was beginning to get very
    tired of sitting by her sister\r\non the bank, and of having nothing to do: 
    once or twice she had\r\npeeped into the book her sister was reading, but it
    had no\r\npictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,'\r\nthought
    Alice `without pictures or conversation?'\r\n\r\n  So she was considering in
    her own mind (as well as she could,\r\nfor the hot day made her feel very sleepy
    and stupid), whether\r\nthe pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the
    trouble\r\nof getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White\r\nRabbit
    with pink eyes ran close by her.\r\n\r\n  There was nothing so VERY remarkable
    in that; nor did Alice\r\nthink it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit
    say to\r\nitself, `Oh dear!  Oh dear!  I shall be late!'  (when she thought\r\nit
    over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have\r\nwondered at this,
    but at the time it all seemed quite natural);\r\nbut when the Rabbit actually
    TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-\r\nPOCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried
    on, Alice started to\r\nher feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had
    never\r\nbefore seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to\r\ntake
    out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the\r\nfield after it,
    and fortunately was just in time to see it pop\r\ndown a large rabbit-hole under
    the hedge.\r\n\r\n  In another moment down went Alice after it, never once\r\nconsidering
    how in the world she was to get out again.\r\n\r\n  The rabbit-hole went straight
    on like a tunnel for some way,\r\nand then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly
    that Alice had not a\r\nmoment to think about stopping herself before she found
    herself\r\nfalling down a very deep well.\r\n\r\n  Either the well was very deep,
    or she fell very slowly, for she\r\nhad plenty of time as she went down to look
    about her and to\r\nwonder what was going to happen next.  First, she tried to
    look\r\ndown and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to\r\nsee
    anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and\r\nnoticed that they
    were filled with cupboards and book-shelves;\r\nhere and there she saw maps and
    pictures hung upon pegs.  She\r\ntook down a jar from one of the shelves as she
    passed; it was\r\nlabelled `ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment
    it\r\nwas empty:  she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing\r\nsomebody,
    so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she\r\nfell past it.\r\n\r\n 
    `Well!' thought Alice to herself, `after such a fall as this, I\r\nshall think
    nothing of tumbling down stairs!  How brave they'll\r\nall think me at home! 
    Why, I wouldn't say anything about it,\r\neven if I fell off the top of the house!'
    (Which was very likely\r\ntrue.)\r\n\r\n  Down, down, down.  Would the fall NEVER
    come to an end!  `I\r\nwonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said
    aloud.\r\n`I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth.  Let\r\nme
    see:  that would be four thousand miles down, I think--' (for,\r\nyou see, Alice
    had learnt several things of this sort in her\r\nlessons in the schoolroom, and
    though this was not a VERY good\r\nopportunity for showing off her knowledge,
    as there was no one to\r\nlisten to her, still it was good practice to say it
    over) `--yes,\r\nthat's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude\r\nor
    Longitude I've got to?'  (Alice had no idea what Latitude was,\r\nor Longitude
    either, but thought they were nice grand words to\r\nsay.)\r\n\r\n  Presently
    she began again.  `I wonder if I shall fall right\r\nTHROUGH the earth!  How
    funny it'll seem to come out among the\r\npeople that walk with their heads downward! 
    The Antipathies, I\r\nthink--' (she was rather glad there WAS no one listening,
    this\r\ntime, as it didn't sound at all the right word) `--but I shall\r\nhave
    to ask them what the name of the country is, you know.\r\nPlease, Ma'am, is this
    New Zealand or Australia?' (and she tried\r\nto curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING
    as you're falling\r\nthrough the air!  Do you think you could manage it?)  `And
    what\r\nan ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking!  No, it'll\r\nnever
    do to ask:  perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'\r\n\r\n  Down, down,
    down.  There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon\r\nbegan talking again.  `Dinah'll
    miss me very much to-night, I\r\nshould think!'  (Dinah was the cat.)  `I hope
    they'll remember\r\nher saucer of milk at tea-time.  Dinah my dear!  I wish you
    were\r\ndown here with me!  There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but\r\nyou
    might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know.\r\nBut do cats eat
    bats, I wonder?'  And here Alice began to get\r\nrather sleepy, and went on saying
    to herself, in a dreamy sort of\r\nway, `Do cats eat bats?  Do cats eat bats?'
    and sometimes, `Do\r\nbats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either\r\nquestion,
    it didn't much matter which way she put it.  She felt\r\nthat she was dozing
    off, and had just begun to dream that she\r\nwas walking hand in hand with Dinah,
    and saying to her very\r\nearnestly, `Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:  did you
    ever eat a\r\nbat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of\r\nsticks
    and dry leaves, and the fall was over.\r\n\r\n  Alice was not a bit hurt, and
    she jumped up on to her feet in a\r\nmoment:  she looked up, but it was all dark
    overhead; before her\r\nwas another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still
    in\r\nsight, hurrying down it.  There was not a moment to be lost:\r\naway went
    Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it\r\nsay, as it turned a corner,
    `Oh my ears and whiskers, how late\r\nit's getting!'  She was close behind it
    when she turned the\r\ncorner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen:  she
    found\r\nherself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps\r\nhanging
    from the roof.\r\n\r\n  There were doors all round the hall, but they were all
    locked;\r\nand when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the\r\nother,
    trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle,\r\nwondering how she was
    ever to get out again.\r\n\r\n  Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged
    table, all made of\r\nsolid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden
    key,\r\nand Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the\r\ndoors
    of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or\r\nthe key was too
    small, but at any rate it would not open any of\r\nthem.  However, on the second
    time round, she came upon a low\r\ncurtain she had not noticed before, and behind
    it was a little\r\ndoor about fifteen inches high:  she tried the little golden
    key\r\nin the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\r\n\r\n  Alice opened
    the door and found that it led into a small\r\npassage, not much larger than
    a rat-hole:  she knelt down and\r\nlooked along the passage into the loveliest
    garden you ever saw.\r\nHow she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander
    about\r\namong those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but\r\nshe
    could not even get her head through the doorway; `and even if\r\nmy head would
    go through,' thought poor Alice, `it would be of\r\nvery little use without my
    shoulders.  Oh, how I wish\r\nI could shut up like a telescope!  I think I could,
    if I only\r\nknow how to begin.'  For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things\r\nhad
    happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few\r\nthings indeed
    were really impossible.\r\n\r\n  There seemed to be no use in waiting by the
    little door, so she\r\nwent back to the table, half hoping she might find another
    key on\r\nit, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like\r\ntelescopes: 
    this time she found a little bottle on it, (`which\r\ncertainly was not here
    before,' said Alice,) and round the neck\r\nof the bottle was a paper label,
    with the words `DRINK ME'\r\nbeautifully printed on it in large letters.\r\n\r\n 
    It was all very well to say `Drink me,' but the wise little\r\nAlice was not
    going to do THAT in a hurry.  `No, I'll look\r\nfirst,' she said, `and see whether
    it's marked \"poison\" or not';\r\nfor she had read several nice little histories
    about children who\r\nhad got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant\r\nthings,
    all because they WOULD not remember the simple rules\r\ntheir friends had taught
    them:  such as, that a red-hot poker\r\nwill burn you if you hold it too long;
    and that if you cut your\r\nfinger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds;
    and she had\r\nnever forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked\r\n`poison,'
    it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n  However,
    this bottle was NOT marked `poison,' so Alice ventured\r\nto taste it, and finding
    it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort\r\nof mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard,
    pine-apple, roast\r\nturkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished\r\nit
    off.\r\n\r\n     *       *       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n        
    *       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     *       *       *      
    *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  `What a curious feeling!' said Alice; `I must
    be shutting up\r\nlike a telescope.'\r\n\r\n  And so it was indeed:  she was
    now only ten inches high, and\r\nher face brightened up at the thought that she
    was now the right\r\nsize for going through the little door into that lovely
    garden.\r\nFirst, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was\r\ngoing
    to shrink any further:  she felt a little nervous about\r\nthis; `for it might
    end, you know,' said Alice to herself, `in my\r\ngoing out altogether, like a
    candle.  I wonder what I should be\r\nlike then?'  And she tried to fancy what
    the flame of a candle is\r\nlike after the candle is blown out, for she could
    not remember\r\never having seen such a thing.\r\n\r\n  After a while, finding
    that nothing more happened, she decided\r\non going into the garden at once;
    but, alas for poor Alice!\r\nwhen she got to the door, she found she had forgotten
    the\r\nlittle golden key, and when she went back to the table for it,\r\nshe
    found she could not possibly reach it:  she could see it\r\nquite plainly through
    the glass, and she tried her best to climb\r\nup one of the legs of the table,
    but it was too slippery;\r\nand when she had tired herself out with trying,\r\nthe
    poor little thing sat down and cried.\r\n\r\n  `Come, there's no use in crying
    like that!' said Alice to\r\nherself, rather sharply; `I advise you to leave
    off this minute!'\r\nShe generally gave herself very good advice, (though she
    very\r\nseldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so\r\nseverely
    as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered\r\ntrying to box her
    own ears for having cheated herself in a game\r\nof croquet she was playing against
    herself, for this curious\r\nchild was very fond of pretending to be two people. 
    `But it's no\r\nuse now,' thought poor Alice, `to pretend to be two people! 
    Why,\r\nthere's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable\r\nperson!'\r\n\r\n 
    Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under\r\nthe table:  she
    opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on\r\nwhich the words `EAT ME'
    were beautifully marked in currants.\r\n`Well, I'll eat it,' said Alice, `and
    if it makes me grow larger,\r\nI can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller,
    I can creep\r\nunder the door; so either way I'll get into the garden, and I\r\ndon't
    care which happens!'\r\n\r\n  She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself,
    `Which\r\nway?  Which way?', holding her hand on the top of her head to\r\nfeel
    which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to\r\nfind that she remained
    the same size:  to be sure, this generally\r\nhappens when one eats cake, but
    Alice had got so much into the\r\nway of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way
    things to happen,\r\nthat it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in
    the\r\ncommon way.\r\n\r\n  So she set to work, and very soon finished off the
    cake.\r\n\r\n     *       *       *       *       *       *       *\r\n        
    *       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<align=center><size=50><color=#B22222>CHAPTER
    II</color></size></align>\r\n\r\n<align=center><size=36><color=#B22222>The Pool
    of Tears</color></size></align>\r\n\r\n\r\n  `Curiouser and curiouser!' cried
    Alice (she was so much\r\nsurprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how
    to speak good\r\nEnglish); `now I'm opening out like the largest telescope that\r\never
    was!  Good-bye, feet!' (for when she looked down at her\r\nfeet, they seemed
    to be almost out of sight, they were getting so\r\nfar off).  `Oh, my poor little
    feet, I wonder who will put on\r\nyour shoes and stockings for you now, dears? 
    I'm sure _I_ shan't\r\nbe able!  I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble
    myself\r\nabout you:  you must manage the best way you can; --but I must be\r\nkind
    to them,' thought Alice, `or perhaps they won't walk the\r\nway I want to go! 
    Let me see:  I'll give them a new pair of\r\nboots every Christmas.'\r\n\r\n 
    And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it.\r\n`They must go
    by the carrier,' she thought; `and how funny it'll\r\nseem, sending presents
    to one's own feet!  And how odd the\r\ndirections will look!\r\n\r\n           
    ALICE'S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ.\r\n                HEARTHRUG,\r\n                   
    NEAR THE FENDER,\r\n                        (WITH ALICE'S LOVE).\r\n\r\nOh dear,
    what nonsense I'm talking!'\r\n\r\n  Just then her head struck against the roof
    of the hall:  in\r\nfact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once
    took\r\nup the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.\r\n\r\n 
    Poor Alice!  It was as much as she could do, lying down on one\r\nside, to look
    through into the garden with one eye; but to get\r\nthrough was more hopeless
    than ever:  she sat down and began to\r\ncry again.\r\n\r\n  `You ought to be
    ashamed of yourself,' said Alice, `a great\r\ngirl like you,' (she might well
    say this), `to go on crying in\r\nthis way!  Stop this moment, I tell you!' 
    But she went on all\r\nthe same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a
    large pool\r\nall round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the\r\nhall.\r\n\r\n 
    After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the\r\ndistance, and she
    hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming.\r\nIt was the White Rabbit returning,
    splendidly dressed, with a\r\npair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large
    fan in the\r\nother:  he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to\r\nhimself
    as he came, `Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won't she\r\nbe savage if I've
    kept her waiting!'  Alice felt so desperate\r\nthat she was ready to ask help
    of any one; so, when the Rabbit\r\ncame near her, she began, in a low, timid
    voice, `If you please,\r\nsir--'  The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white
    kid\r\ngloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard\r\nas
    he could go.\r\n\r\n  Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was
    very\r\nhot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking:\r\n`Dear,
    dear!  How queer everything is to-day!  And yesterday\r\nthings went on just
    as usual.  I wonder if I've been changed in\r\nthe night?  Let me think:  was
    I the same when I got up this\r\nmorning?  I almost think I can remember feeling
    a little\r\ndifferent.  But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Who in\r\nthe
    world am I?  Ah, THAT'S the great puzzle!'  And she began\r\nthinking over all
    the children she knew that were of the same age\r\nas herself, to see if she
    could have been changed for any of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n  `I'm sure I'm not Ada,'
    she said, `for her hair goes in such\r\nlong ringlets, and mine doesn't go in
    ringlets at all; and I'm\r\nsure I can't be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things,
    and she,\r\noh! she knows such a very little!  Besides, SHE'S she, and I'm I,\r\nand--oh
    dear, how puzzling it all is!  I'll try if I know all the\r\nthings I used to
    know.  Let me see:  four times five is twelve,\r\nand four times six is thirteen,
    and four times seven is--oh dear!\r\nI shall never get to twenty at that rate! 
    However, the\r\nMultiplication Table doesn't signify:  let's try Geography.\r\nLondon
    is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome,\r\nand Rome--no, THAT'S
    all wrong, I'm certain!  I must have been\r\nchanged for Mabel!  I'll try and
    say \"How doth the little--\"'\r\nand she crossed her hands on her lap as if
    she were saying lessons,\r\nand began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse
    and\r\nstrange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:--\r\n\r\n           
    `How doth the little crocodile\r\n              Improve his shining tail,\r\n           
    And pour the waters of the Nile\r\n              On every golden scale!\r\n\r\n           
    `How cheerfully he seems to grin,\r\n              How neatly spread his claws,\r\n           
    And welcome little fishes in\r\n              With gently smiling jaws!'\r\n\r\n 
    `I'm sure those are not the right words,' said poor Alice, and\r\nher eyes filled
    with tears again as she went on, `I must be Mabel\r\nafter all, and I shall have
    to go and live in that poky little\r\nhouse, and have next to no toys to play
    with, and oh! ever so\r\nmany lessons to learn!  No, I've made up my mind about
    it; if I'm\r\nMabel, I'll stay down here!  It'll be no use their putting their\r\nheads
    down and saying \"Come up again, dear!\"  I shall only look\r\nup and say \"Who
    am I then?  Tell me that first, and then, if I\r\nlike being that person, I'll
    come up:  if not, I'll stay down\r\nhere till I'm somebody else\"--but, oh dear!'
    cried Alice, with a\r\nsudden burst of tears, `I do wish they WOULD put their
    heads\r\ndown!  I am so VERY tired of being all alone here!'\r\n\r\n  As she
    said this she looked down at her hands, and was\r\nsurprised to see that she
    had put on one of the Rabbit's little\r\nwhite kid gloves while she was talking. 
    `How CAN I have done\r\nthat?' she thought.  `I must be growing small again.' 
    She got up\r\nand went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that,\r\nas
    nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high,\r\nand was going
    on shrinking rapidly:  she soon found out that the\r\ncause of this was the fan
    she was holding, and she dropped it\r\nhastily, just in time to avoid shrinking
    away altogether.\r\n\r\n`That WAS a narrow escape!' said Alice, a good deal frightened
    at\r\nthe sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in\r\nexistence;
    `and now for the garden!' and she ran with all speed\r\nback to the little door: 
    but, alas! the little door was shut\r\nagain, and the little golden key was lying
    on the glass table as\r\nbefore, `and things are worse than ever,' thought the
    poor child,\r\n`for I never was so small as this before, never!  And I declare\r\nit's
    too bad, that it is!'\r\n\r\n  As she said these words her foot slipped, and
    in another\r\nmoment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt water.  Her first\r\nidea
    was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, `and in that\r\ncase I can go back
    by railway,' she said to herself.  (Alice had\r\nbeen to the seaside once in
    her life, and had come to the general\r\nconclusion, that wherever you go to
    on the English coast you find\r\na number of bathing machines in the sea, some
    children digging in\r\nthe sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses,
    and\r\nbehind them a railway station.)  However, she soon made out that\r\nshe
    was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine\r\nfeet high.\r\n\r\n 
    `I wish I hadn't cried so much!' said Alice, as she swam about,\r\ntrying to
    find her way out.  `I shall be punished for it now, I\r\nsuppose, by being drowned
    in my own tears!  That WILL be a queer\r\nthing, to be sure!  However, everything
    is queer to-day.'\r\n\r\n  Just then she heard something splashing about in the
    pool a\r\nlittle way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was:  at\r\nfirst
    she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then\r\nshe remembered how
    small she was now, and she soon made out that\r\nit was only a mouse that had
    slipped in like herself.\r\n\r\n  `Would it be of any use, now,' thought Alice,
    `to speak to this\r\nmouse?  Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that
    I should\r\nthink very likely it can talk:  at any rate, there's no harm in\r\ntrying.' 
    So she began:  `O Mouse, do you know the way out of\r\nthis pool?  I am very
    tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!'\r\n(Alice thought this must be the right
    way of speaking to a mouse:\r\nshe had never done such a thing before, but she
    remembered having\r\nseen in her brother's Latin Grammar, `A mouse--of a mouse--to
    a\r\nmouse--a mouse--O mouse!')  The Mouse looked at her rather\r\ninquisitively,
    and seemed to her to wink with one of its little\r\neyes, but it said nothing.\r\n\r\n 
    `Perhaps it doesn't understand English,' thought Alice; `I\r\ndaresay it's a
    French mouse, come over with William the\r\nConqueror.'  (For, with all her knowledge
    of history, Alice had\r\nno very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.) 
    So she\r\nbegan again:  `Ou est ma chatte?' which was the first sentence in\r\nher
    French lesson-book.  The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the\r\nwater, and seemed
    to quiver all over with fright.  `Oh, I beg\r\nyour pardon!' cried Alice hastily,
    afraid that she had hurt the\r\npoor animal's feelings.  `I quite forgot you
    didn't like cats.'\r\n\r\n  `Not like cats!' cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate\r\nvoice. 
    `Would YOU like cats if you were me?'\r\n\r\n  `Well, perhaps not,' said Alice
    in a soothing tone:  `don't be\r\nangry about it.  And yet I wish I could show
    you our cat Dinah:\r\nI think you'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see
    her.\r\nShe is such a dear quiet thing,' Alice went on, half to herself,\r\nas
    she swam lazily about in the pool, `and she sits purring so\r\nnicely by the
    fire, licking her paws and washing her face--and\r\nshe is such a nice soft thing
    to nurse--and she's such a capital\r\none for catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon!'
    cried Alice again,\r\nfor this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she
    felt\r\ncertain it must be really offended.  `We won't talk about her any\r\nmore
    if you'd rather not.'\r\n\r\n  `We indeed!' cried the Mouse, who was trembling
    down to the end\r\nof his tail.  `As if I would talk on such a subject!  Our
    family\r\nalways HATED cats:  nasty, low, vulgar things!  Don't let me hear\r\nthe
    name again!'\r\n\r\n  `I won't indeed!' said Alice, in a great hurry to change
    the\r\nsubject of conversation.  `Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?'\r\nThe
    Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly:  `There is\r\nsuch a nice little
    dog near our house I should like to show you!\r\nA little bright-eyed terrier,
    you know, with oh, such long curly\r\nbrown hair!  And it'll fetch things when
    you throw them, and\r\nit'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of
    things--I\r\ncan't remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer, you\r\nknow,
    and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds!\r\nHe says it kills
    all the rats and--oh dear!' cried Alice in a\r\nsorrowful tone, `I'm afraid I've
    offended it again!'  For the\r\nMouse was swimming away from her as hard as it
    could go, and\r\nmaking quite a commotion in the pool as it went.\r\n\r\n  So
    she called softly after it, `Mouse dear!  Do come back\r\nagain, and we won't
    talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't\r\nlike them!'  When the Mouse heard
    this, it turned round and swam\r\nslowly back to her:  its face was quite pale
    (with passion, Alice\r\nthought), and it said in a low trembling voice, `Let
    us get to\r\nthe shore, and then I'll tell you my history, and you'll\r\nunderstand
    why it is I hate cats and dogs.'\r\n\r\n  It was high time to go, for the pool
    was getting quite crowded\r\nwith the birds and animals that had fallen into
    it:  there were a\r\nDuck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other
    curious\r\ncreatures.  Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the\r\nshore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<align=center><size=50><color=#B22222>CHAPTER
    III</color></size></align>\r\n\r\n<align=center><size=36><color=#B22222>A Caucus-Race
    and a Long Tale</color></size></align>\r\n\r\n\r\n  They were indeed a queer-looking
    party that assembled on the\r\nbank--the birds with draggled feathers, the animals
    with their\r\nfur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and\r\nuncomfortable.\r\n\r\n 
    The first question of course was, how to get dry again:  they\r\nhad a consultation
    about this, and after a few minutes it seemed\r\nquite natural to Alice to find
    herself talking familiarly with\r\nthem, as if she had known them all her life. 
    Indeed, she had\r\nquite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky,\r\nand
    would only say, `I am older than you, and must know better';\r\nand this Alice
    would not allow without knowing how old it was,\r\nand, as the Lory positively
    refused to tell its age, there was no\r\nmore to be said.\r\n\r\n  At last the
    Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among\r\nthem, called out, `Sit
    down, all of you, and listen to me!  I'LL\r\nsoon make you dry enough!'  They
    all sat down at once, in a large\r\nring, with the Mouse in the middle.  Alice
    kept her eyes\r\nanxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad\r\ncold
    if she did not get dry very soon.\r\n\r\n  `Ahem!' said the Mouse with an important
    air, `are you all ready?\r\nThis is the driest thing I know.  Silence all round,
    if you please!\r\n\"William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope,
    was\r\nsoon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been\r\nof
    late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest.  Edwin and\r\nMorcar, the earls
    of Mercia and Northumbria--\"'\r\n\r\n  `Ugh!' said the Lory, with a shiver.\r\n\r\n 
    `I beg your pardon!' said the Mouse, frowning, but very\r\npolitely:  `Did you
    speak?'\r\n\r\n  `Not I!' said the Lory hastily.\r\n\r\n  `I thought you did,'
    said the Mouse.  `--I proceed.  \"Edwin and\r\nMorcar, the earls of Mercia and
    Northumbria, declared for him:\r\nand even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop
    of Canterbury, found\r\nit advisable--\"'\r\n\r\n  `Found WHAT?' said the Duck.\r\n\r\n 
    `Found IT,' the Mouse replied rather crossly:  `of course you\r\nknow what \"it\"
    means.'\r\n\r\n  `I know what \"it\" means well enough, when I find a thing,'
    said\r\nthe Duck:  `it's generally a frog or a worm.  The question is,\r\nwhat
    did the archbishop find?'\r\n\r\n  The Mouse did not notice this question, but
    hurriedly went on,\r\n`\"--found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet
    William\r\nand offer him the crown.  William's conduct at first was\r\nmoderate. 
    But the insolence of his Normans--\"  How are you\r\ngetting on now, my dear?'
    it continued, turning to Alice as it\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\n  `As wet as ever,' said
    Alice in a melancholy tone:  `it doesn't\r\nseem to dry me at all.'\r\n\r\n 
    `In that case,' said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, `I\r\nmove that the
    meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more\r\nenergetic remedies--'\r\n\r\n 
    `Speak English!' said the Eaglet.  `I don't know the meaning of\r\nhalf those
    long words, and, what's more, I don't believe you do\r\neither!'  And the Eaglet
    bent down its head to hide a smile:\r\nsome of the other birds tittered audibly.\r\n\r\n 
    `What I was going to say,' said the Dodo in an offended tone,\r\n`was, that the
    best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.'\r\n\r\n  `What IS a Caucus-race?'
    said Alice; not that she wanted much\r\nto know, but the Dodo had paused as if
    it thought that SOMEBODY\r\nought to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to
    say anything.\r\n\r\n  `Why,' said the Dodo, `the best way to explain it is to
    do it.'\r\n(And, as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter\r\nday,
    I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.)\r\n\r\n  First it marked out a race-course,
    in a sort of circle, (`the\r\nexact shape doesn't matter,' it said,) and then
    all the party\r\nwere placed along the course, here and there.  There was no
    `One,\r\ntwo, three, and away,' but they began running when they liked,\r\nand
    left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know\r\nwhen the race was
    over.  However, when they had been running half\r\nan hour or so, and were quite
    dry again, the Dodo suddenly called\r\nout `The race is over!' and they all crowded
    round it, panting,\r\nand asking, `But who has won?'\r\n\r\n  This question the
    Dodo could not answer without a great deal of\r\nthought, and it sat for a long
    time with one finger pressed upon\r\nits forehead (the position in which you
    usually see Shakespeare,\r\nin the pictures of him), while the rest waited in
    silence.  At\r\nlast the Dodo said, `EVERYBODY has won, and all must have\r\nprizes.'\r\n\r\n 
    `But who is to give the prizes?' quite a chorus of voices\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n 
    `Why, SHE, of course,' said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with\r\none finger; and
    the whole party at once crowded round her,\r\ncalling out in a confused way,
    `Prizes! Prizes!'\r\n\r\n  Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put
    her hand\r\nin her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt\r\nwater
    had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes.\r\nThere was exactly one
    a-piece all round.\r\n\r\n  `But she must have a prize herself, you know,' said
    the Mouse.\r\n\r\n  `Of course,' the Dodo replied very gravely.  `What else have\r\nyou
    got in your pocket?' he went on, turning to Alice.\r\n\r\n  `Only a thimble,'
    said Alice sadly.\r\n\r\n  `Hand it over here,' said the Dodo.\r\n\r\n  Then
    they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo\r\nsolemnly presented the
    thimble, saying `We beg your acceptance of\r\nthis elegant thimble'; and, when
    it had finished this short\r\nspeech, they all cheered.\r\n\r\n  Alice thought
    the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked\r\nso grave that she did not
    dare to laugh; and, as she could not\r\nthink of anything to say, she simply
    bowed, and took the thimble,\r\nlooking as solemn as she could.\r\n\r\n  The
    next thing was to eat the comfits:  this caused some noise\r\nand confusion,
    as the large birds complained that they could not\r\ntaste theirs, and the small
    ones choked and had to be patted on\r\nthe back.  However, it was over at last,
    and they sat down again\r\nin a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something
    more.\r\n\r\n  `You promised to tell me your history, you know,' said Alice,\r\n`and
    why it is you hate--C and D,' she added in a whisper, half\r\nafraid that it
    would be offended again.\r\n\r\n  `Mine is a long and a sad tale!' said the Mouse,
    turning to\r\nAlice, and sighing.\r\n\r\n  `It IS a long tail, certainly,' said
    Alice, looking down with\r\nwonder at the Mouse's tail; `but why do you call
    it sad?'  And\r\nshe kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking,
    so\r\nthat her idea of the tale was something like this:--\r\n\r\n                   
    `Fury said to a\r\n                   mouse, That he\r\n                 met
    in the\r\n               house,\r\n            \"Let us\r\n              both
    go to\r\n                law:  I will\r\n                  prosecute\r\n                   
    YOU.  --Come,\r\n                       I'll take no\r\n                       
    denial; We\r\n                     must have a\r\n                 trial:  For\r\n             
    really this\r\n           morning I've\r\n          nothing\r\n         to do.\"\r\n          
    Said the\r\n             mouse to the\r\n               cur, \"Such\r\n                
    a trial,\r\n                   dear Sir,\r\n                         With\r\n                    
    no jury\r\n                  or judge,\r\n                would be\r\n             
    wasting\r\n             our\r\n              breath.\"\r\n               \"I'll
    be\r\n                 judge, I'll\r\n                   be jury,\"\r\n                        
    Said\r\n                    cunning\r\n                      old Fury:\r\n                    
    \"I'll\r\n                      try the\r\n                         whole\r\n                         
    cause,\r\n                             and\r\n                        condemn\r\n                      
    you\r\n                      to\r\n                       death.\"'\r\n\r\n\r\n 
    `You are not attending!' said the Mouse to Alice severely.\r\n`What are you thinking
    of?'\r\n\r\n  `I beg your pardon,' said Alice very humbly:  `you had got to\r\nthe
    fifth bend, I think?'\r\n\r\n  `I had NOT!' cried the Mouse, sharply and very
    angrily.\r\n\r\n  `A knot!' said Alice, always ready to make herself useful,
    and\r\nlooking anxiously about her.  `Oh, do let me help to undo it!'\r\n\r\n 
    `I shall do nothing of the sort,' said the Mouse, getting up\r\nand walking away. 
    `You insult me by talking such nonsense!'\r\n\r\n  `I didn't mean it!' pleaded
    poor Alice.  `But you're so easily\r\noffended, you know!'\r\n\r\n  The Mouse
    only growled in reply.\r\n\r\n  `Please come back and finish your story!' Alice
    called after\r\nit; and the others all joined in chorus, `Yes, please do!' but\r\nthe
    Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little\r\nquicker.\r\n\r\n 
    `What a pity it wouldn't stay!' sighed the Lory, as soon as it\r\nwas quite out
    of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of\r\nsaying to her daughter `Ah,
    my dear!  Let this be a lesson to you\r\nnever to lose YOUR temper!'  `Hold your
    tongue, Ma!' said the\r\nyoung Crab, a little snappishly.  `You're enough to
    try the\r\npatience of an oyster!'\r\n\r\n  `I wish I had our Dinah here, I know
    I do!' said Alice aloud,\r\naddressing nobody in particular.  `She'd soon fetch
    it back!'\r\n\r\n  `And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?'\r\nsaid
    the Lory.\r\n\r\n  Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about\r\nher
    pet:  `Dinah's our cat.  And she's such a capital one for\r\ncatching mice you
    can't think!  And oh, I wish you could see her\r\nafter the birds!  Why, she'll
    eat a little bird as soon as look\r\nat it!'\r\n\r\n  This speech caused a remarkable
    sensation among the party.\r\nSome of the birds hurried off at once:  one old
    Magpie began\r\nwrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, `I really must
    be\r\ngetting home; the night-air doesn't suit my throat!' and a Canary\r\ncalled
    out in a trembling voice to its children, `Come away, my\r\ndears!  It's high
    time you were all in bed!'  On various pretexts\r\nthey all moved off, and Alice
    was soon left alone.\r\n\r\n  `I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah!' she said to
    herself in a\r\nmelancholy tone.  `Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I'm\r\nsure
    she's the best cat in the world!  Oh, my dear Dinah!  I\r\nwonder if I shall
    ever see you any more!'  And here poor Alice\r\nbegan to cry again, for she felt
    very lonely and low-spirited.\r\nIn a little while, however, she again heard
    a little pattering of\r\nfootsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly,
    half hoping\r\nthat the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to\r\nfinish
    his story."

    the Rabbit-Hole</color></size></align>\r\n\r\n  Alice was beginning to get very
    tired of sitting by her sister\r\non the bank, and of having nothing to do: 
    once or twice she had\r\npeeped into the book her sister was reading, but it
    had no\r\npictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,'\r\nthought
    Alice `without pictures or conversation?'\r\n\r\n  So she was considering in
    her own mind (as well as she could,\r\nfor the hot day made her feel very sleepy
    and stupid), whether\r\nthe pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the
    trouble\r\nof getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White\r\nRabbit
    with pink eyes ran close by her.\r\n\r\n  There was nothing so VERY remarkable
    in that; nor did Alice\r\nthink it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit
    say to\r\nitself, `Oh dear!  Oh dear!  I shall be late!'  (when she thought\r\nit
    over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have\r\nwondered at this,
    but at the time it all seemed quite natural);\r\nbut when the Rabbit actually
    TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-\r\nPOCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried
    on, Alice started to\r\nher feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had
    never\r\nbefore seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to\r\ntake
    out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the\r\nfield after it,
    and fortunately was just in time to see it pop\r\ndown a large rabbit-hole under
    the hedge.\r\n\r\n  In another moment down went Alice after it, never once\r\nconsidering
    how in the world she was to get out again.\r\n\r\n  The rabbit-hole went straight
    on like a tunnel for some way,\r\nand then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly
    that Alice had not a\r\nmoment to think about stopping herself before she found
    herself\r\nfalling down a very deep well.\r\n\r\n  Either the well was very deep,
    or she fell very slowly, for she\r\nhad plenty of time as she went down to look
    about her and to\r\nwonder what was going to happen next.  First, she tried to
    look\r\ndown and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to\r\nsee
    anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and\r\nnoticed that they
    were filled with cupboards and book-shelves;\r\nhere and there she saw maps and
    pictures hung upon pegs.  She\r\ntook down a jar from one of the shelves as she
    passed; it was\r\nlabelled `ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment
    it\r\nwas empty:  she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing\r\nsomebody,
    so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she\r\nfell past it.\r\n\r\n 
    `Well!' thought Alice to herself, `after such a fall as this, I\r\nshall think
    nothing of tumbling down stairs!  How brave they'll\r\nall think me at home! 
    Why, I wouldn't say anything about it,\r\neven if I fell off the top of the house!'
    (Which was very likely\r\ntrue.)\r\n\r\n  Down, down, down.  Would the fall NEVER
    come to an end!  `I\r\nwonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said
    aloud.\r\n`I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth.  Let\r\nme
    see:  that would be four thousand miles down, I think--' (for,\r\nyou see, Alice
    had learnt several things of this sort in her\r\nlessons in the schoolroom, and
    though this was not a VERY good\r\nopportunity for showing off her knowledge,
    as there was no one to\r\nlisten to her, still it was good practice to say it
    over) `--yes,\r\nthat's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude\r\nor
    Longitude I've got to?'  (Alice had no idea what Latitude was,\r\nor Longitude
    either, but thought they were nice grand words to\r\nsay.)\r\n\r\n  Presently
    she began again.  `I wonder if I shall fall right\r\nTHROUGH the earth!  How
    funny it'll seem to come out among the\r\npeople that walk with their heads downward! 
    The Antipathies, I\r\nthink--' (she was rather glad there WAS no one listening,
    this\r\ntime, as it didn't sound at all the right word) `--but I shall\r\nhave
    to ask them what the name of the country is, you know.\r\nPlease, Ma'am, is this
    New Zealand or Australia?' (and she tried\r\nto curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING
    as you're falling\r\nthrough the air!  Do you think you could manage it?)  `And
    what\r\nan ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking!  No, it'll\r\nnever
    do to ask:  perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'\r\n\r\n  Down, down,
    down.  There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon\r\nbegan talking again.  `Dinah'll
    miss me very much to-night, I\r\nshould think!'  (Dinah was the cat.)  `I hope
    they'll remember\r\nher saucer of milk at tea-time.  Dinah my dear!  I wish you
    were\r\ndown here with me!  There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but\r\nyou
    might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know.\r\nBut do cats eat
    bats, I wonder?'  And here Alice began to get\r\nrather sleepy, and went on saying
    to herself, in a dreamy sort of\r\nway, `Do cats eat bats?  Do cats eat bats?'
    and sometimes, `Do\r\nbats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either\r\nquestion,
    it didn't much matter which way she put it.  She felt\r\nthat she was dozing
    off, and had just begun to dream that she\r\nwas walking hand in hand with Dinah,
    and saying to her very\r\nearnestly, `Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:  did you
    ever eat a\r\nbat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of\r\nsticks
    and dry leaves, and the fall was over.\r\n\r\n  Alice was not a bit hurt, and
    she jumped up on to her feet in a\r\nmoment:  she looked up, but it was all dark
    overhead; before her\r\nwas another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still
    in\r\nsight, hurrying down it.  There was not a moment to be lost:\r\naway went
    Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it\r\nsay, as it turned a corner,
    `Oh my ears and whiskers, how late\r\nit's getting!'  She was close behind it
    when she turned the\r\ncorner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen:  she
    found\r\nherself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps\r\nhanging
    from the roof.\r\n\r\n  There were doors all round the hall, but they were all
    locked;\r\nand when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the\r\nother,
    trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle,\r\nwondering how she was
    ever to get out again.\r\n\r\n  Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged
    table, all made of\r\nsolid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden
    key,\r\nand Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the\r\ndoors
    of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or\r\nthe key was too
    small, but at any rate it would not open any of\r\nthem.  However, on the second
    time round, she came upon a low\r\ncurtain she had not noticed before, and behind
    it was a little\r\ndoor about fifteen inches high:  she tried the little golden
    key\r\nin the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\r\n\r\n  Alice opened
    the door and found that it led into a small\r\npassage, not much larger than
    a rat-hole:  she knelt down and\r\nlooked along the passage into the loveliest
    garden you ever saw.\r\nHow she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander
    about\r\namong those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but\r\nshe
    could not even get her head through the doorway; `and even if\r\nmy head would
    go through,' thought poor Alice, `it would be of\r\nvery little use without my
    shoulders.  Oh, how I wish\r\nI could shut up like a telescope!  I think I could,
    if I only\r\nknow how to begin.'  For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things\r\nhad
    happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few\r\nthings indeed
    were really impossible.\r\n\r\n  There seemed to be no use in waiting by the
    little door, so she\r\nwent back to the table, half hoping she might find another
    key on\r\nit, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like\r\ntelescopes: 
    this time she found a little bottle on it, (`which\r\ncertainly was not here
    before,' said Alice,) and round the neck\r\nof the bottle was a paper label,
    with the words `DRINK ME'\r\nbeautifully printed on it in large letters.\r\n\r\n 
    It was all very well to say `Drink me,' but the wise little\r\nAlice was not
    going to do THAT in a hurry.  `No, I'll look\r\nfirst,' she said, `and see whether
    it's marked \"poison\" or not';\r\nfor she had read several nice little histories
    about children who\r\nhad got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant\r\nthings,
    all because they WOULD not remember the simple rules\r\ntheir friends had taught
    them:  such as, that a red-hot poker\r\nwill burn you if you hold it too long;
    and that if you cut your\r\nfinger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds;
    and she had\r\nnever forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked\r\n`poison,'
    it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n  However,
    this bottle was NOT marked `poison,' so Alice ventured\r\nto taste it, and finding
    it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort\r\nof mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard,
    pine-apple, roast\r\nturkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished\r\nit
    off.\r\n\r\n     *       *       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n        
    *       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     *       *       *      
    *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  `What a curious feeling!' said Alice; `I must
    be shutting up\r\nlike a telescope.'\r\n\r\n  And so it was indeed:  she was
    now only ten inches high, and\r\nher face brightened up at the thought that she
    was now the right\r\nsize for going through the little door into that lovely
    garden.\r\nFirst, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was\r\ngoing
    to shrink any further:  she felt a little nervous about\r\nthis; `for it might
    end, you know,' said Alice to herself, `in my\r\ngoing out altogether, like a
    candle.  I wonder what I should be\r\nlike then?'  And she tried to fancy what
    the flame of a candle is\r\nlike after the candle is blown out, for she could
    not remember\r\never having seen such a thing.\r\n\r\n  After a while, finding
    that nothing more happened, she decided\r\non going into the garden at once;
    but, alas for poor Alice!\r\nwhen she got to the door, she found she had forgotten
    the\r\nlittle golden key, and when she went back to the table for it,\r\nshe
    found she could not possibly reach it:  she could see it\r\nquite plainly through
    the glass, and she tried her best to climb\r\nup one of the legs of the table,
    but it was too slippery;\r\nand when she had tired herself out with trying,\r\nthe
    poor little thing sat down and cried.\r\n\r\n  `Come, there's no use in crying
    like that!' said Alice to\r\nherself, rather sharply; `I advise you to leave
    off this minute!'\r\nShe generally gave herself very good advice, (though she
    very\r\nseldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so\r\nseverely
    as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered\r\ntrying to box her
    own ears for having cheated herself in a game\r\nof croquet she was playing against
    herself, for this curious\r\nchild was very fond of pretending to be two people. 
    `But it's no\r\nuse now,' thought poor Alice, `to pretend to be two people! 
    Why,\r\nthere's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable\r\nperson!'\r\n\r\n 
    Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under\r\nthe table:  she
    opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on\r\nwhich the words `EAT ME'
    were beautifully marked in currants.\r\n`Well, I'll eat it,' said Alice, `and
    if it makes me grow larger,\r\nI can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller,
    I can creep\r\nunder the door; so either way I'll get into the garden, and I\r\ndon't
    care which happens!'\r\n\r\n  She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself,
    `Which\r\nway?  Which way?', holding her hand on the top of her head to\r\nfeel
    which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to\r\nfind that she remained
    the same size:  to be sure, this generally\r\nhappens when one eats cake, but
    Alice had got so much into the\r\nway of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way
    things to happen,\r\nthat it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in
    the\r\ncommon way.\r\n\r\n  So she set to work, and very soon finished off the
    cake.\r\n\r\n     *       *       *       *       *       *       *\r\n        
    *       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<align=center><size=50><color=#B22222>CHAPTER
    II</color></size></align>\r\n\r\n<align=center><size=36><color=#B22222>The Pool
    of Tears</color></size></align>\r\n\r\n\r\n  `Curiouser and curiouser!' cried
    Alice (she was so much\r\nsurprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how
    to speak good\r\nEnglish); `now I'm opening out like the largest telescope that\r\never
    was!  Good-bye, feet!' (for when she looked down at her\r\nfeet, they seemed
    to be almost out of sight, they were getting so\r\nfar off).  `Oh, my poor little
    feet, I wonder who will put on\r\nyour shoes and stockings for you now, dears? 
    I'm sure _I_ shan't\r\nbe able!  I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble
    myself\r\nabout you:  you must manage the best way you can; --but I must be\r\nkind
    to them,' thought Alice, `or perhaps they won't walk the\r\nway I want to go! 
    Let me see:  I'll give them a new pair of\r\nboots every Christmas.'\r\n\r\n 
    And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it.\r\n`They must go
    by the carrier,' she thought; `and how funny it'll\r\nseem, sending presents
    to one's own feet!  And how odd the\r\ndirections will look!\r\n\r\n           
    ALICE'S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ.\r\n                HEARTHRUG,\r\n                   
    NEAR THE FENDER,\r\n                        (WITH ALICE'S LOVE).\r\n\r\nOh dear,
    what nonsense I'm talking!'\r\n\r\n  Just then her head struck against the roof
    of the hall:  in\r\nfact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once
    took\r\nup the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.\r\n\r\n 
    Poor Alice!  It was as much as she could do, lying down on one\r\nside, to look
    through into the garden with one eye; but to get\r\nthrough was more hopeless
    than ever:  she sat down and began to\r\ncry again.\r\n\r\n  `You ought to be
    ashamed of yourself,' said Alice, `a great\r\ngirl like you,' (she might well
    say this), `to go on crying in\r\nthis way!  Stop this moment, I tell you!' 
    But she went on all\r\nthe same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a
    large pool\r\nall round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the\r\nhall.\r\n\r\n 
    After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the\r\ndistance, and she
    hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming.\r\nIt was the White Rabbit returning,
    splendidly dressed, with a\r\npair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large
    fan in the\r\nother:  he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to\r\nhimself
    as he came, `Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won't she\r\nbe savage if I've
    kept her waiting!'  Alice felt so desperate\r\nthat she was ready to ask help
    of any one; so, when the Rabbit\r\ncame near her, she began, in a low, timid
    voice, `If you please,\r\nsir--'  The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white
    kid\r\ngloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard\r\nas
    he could go.\r\n\r\n  Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was
    very\r\nhot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking:\r\n`Dear,
    dear!  How queer everything is to-day!  And yesterday\r\nthings went on just
    as usual.  I wonder if I've been changed in\r\nthe night?  Let me think:  was
    I the same when I got up this\r\nmorning?  I almost think I can remember feeling
    a little\r\ndifferent.  But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Who in\r\nthe
    world am I?  Ah, THAT'S the great puzzle!'  And she began\r\nthinking over all
    the children she knew that were of the same age\r\nas herself, to see if she
    could have been changed for any of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n  `I'm sure I'm not Ada,'
    she said, `for her hair goes in such\r\nlong ringlets, and mine doesn't go in
    ringlets at all; and I'm\r\nsure I can't be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things,
    and she,\r\noh! she knows such a very little!  Besides, SHE'S she, and I'm I,\r\nand--oh
    dear, how puzzling it all is!  I'll try if I know all the\r\nthings I used to
    know.  Let me see:  four times five is twelve,\r\nand four times six is thirteen,
    and four times seven is--oh dear!\r\nI shall never get to twenty at that rate! 
    However, the\r\nMultiplication Table doesn't signify:  let's try Geography.\r\nLondon
    is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome,\r\nand Rome--no, THAT'S
    all wrong, I'm certain!  I must have been\r\nchanged for Mabel!  I'll try and
    say \"How doth the little--\"'\r\nand she crossed her hands on her lap as if
    she were saying lessons,\r\nand began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse
    and\r\nstrange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:--\r\n\r\n           
    `How doth the little crocodile\r\n              Improve his shining tail,\r\n           
    And pour the waters of the Nile\r\n              On every golden scale!\r\n\r\n           
    `How cheerfully he seems to grin,\r\n              How neatly spread his claws,\r\n           
    And welcome little fishes in\r\n              With gently smiling jaws!'\r\n\r\n 
    `I'm sure those are not the right words,' said poor Alice, and\r\nher eyes filled
    with tears again as she went on, `I must be Mabel\r\nafter all, and I shall have
    to go and live in that poky little\r\nhouse, and have next to no toys to play
    with, and oh! ever so\r\nmany lessons to learn!  No, I've made up my mind about
    it; if I'm\r\nMabel, I'll stay down here!  It'll be no use their putting their\r\nheads
    down and saying \"Come up again, dear!\"  I shall only look\r\nup and say \"Who
    am I then?  Tell me that first, and then, if I\r\nlike being that person, I'll
    come up:  if not, I'll stay down\r\nhere till I'm somebody else\"--but, oh dear!'
    cried Alice, with a\r\nsudden burst of tears, `I do wish they WOULD put their
    heads\r\ndown!  I am so VERY tired of being all alone here!'\r\n\r\n  As she
    said this she looked down at her hands, and was\r\nsurprised to see that she
    had put on one of the Rabbit's little\r\nwhite kid gloves while she was talking. 
    `How CAN I have done\r\nthat?' she thought.  `I must be growing small again.' 
    She got up\r\nand went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that,\r\nas
    nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high,\r\nand was going
    on shrinking rapidly:  she soon found out that the\r\ncause of this was the fan
    she was holding, and she dropped it\r\nhastily, just in time to avoid shrinking
    away altogether.\r\n\r\n`That WAS a narrow escape!' said Alice, a good deal frightened
    at\r\nthe sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in\r\nexistence;
    `and now for the garden!' and she ran with all speed\r\nback to the little door: 
    but, alas! the little door was shut\r\nagain, and the little golden key was lying
    on the glass table as\r\nbefore, `and things are worse than ever,' thought the
    poor child,\r\n`for I never was so small as this before, never!  And I declare\r\nit's
    too bad, that it is!'\r\n\r\n  As she said these words her foot slipped, and
    in another\r\nmoment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt water.  Her first\r\nidea
    was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, `and in that\r\ncase I can go back
    by railway,' she said to herself.  (Alice had\r\nbeen to the seaside once in
    her life, and had come to the general\r\nconclusion, that wherever you go to
    on the English coast you find\r\na number of bathing machines in the sea, some
    children digging in\r\nthe sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses,
    and\r\nbehind them a railway station.)  However, she soon made out that\r\nshe
    was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine\r\nfeet high.\r\n\r\n 
    `I wish I hadn't cried so much!' said Alice, as she swam about,\r\ntrying to
    find her way out.  `I shall be punished for it now, I\r\nsuppose, by being drowned
    in my own tears!  That WILL be a queer\r\nthing, to be sure!  However, everything
    is queer to-day.'\r\n\r\n  Just then she heard something splashing about in the
    pool a\r\nlittle way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was:  at\r\nfirst
    she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then\r\nshe remembered how
    small she was now, and she soon made out that\r\nit was only a mouse that had
    slipped in like herself.\r\n\r\n  `Would it be of any use, now,' thought Alice,
    `to speak to this\r\nmouse?  Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that
    I should\r\nthink very likely it can talk:  at any rate, there's no harm in\r\ntrying.' 
    So she began:  `O Mouse, do you know the way out of\r\nthis pool?  I am very
    tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!'\r\n(Alice thought this must be the right
    way of speaking to a mouse:\r\nshe had never done such a thing before, but she
    remembered having\r\nseen in her brother's Latin Grammar, `A mouse--of a mouse--to
    a\r\nmouse--a mouse--O mouse!')  The Mouse looked at her rather\r\ninquisitively,
    and seemed to her to wink with one of its little\r\neyes, but it said nothing.\r\n\r\n 
    `Perhaps it doesn't understand English,' thought Alice; `I\r\ndaresay it's a
    French mouse, come over with William the\r\nConqueror.'  (For, with all her knowledge
    of history, Alice had\r\nno very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.) 
    So she\r\nbegan again:  `Ou est ma chatte?' which was the first sentence in\r\nher
    French lesson-book.  The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the\r\nwater, and seemed
    to quiver all over with fright.  `Oh, I beg\r\nyour pardon!' cried Alice hastily,
    afraid that she had hurt the\r\npoor animal's feelings.  `I quite forgot you
    didn't like cats.'\r\n\r\n  `Not like cats!' cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate\r\nvoice. 
    `Would YOU like cats if you were me?'\r\n\r\n  `Well, perhaps not,' said Alice
    in a soothing tone:  `don't be\r\nangry about it.  And yet I wish I could show
    you our cat Dinah:\r\nI think you'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see
    her.\r\nShe is such a dear quiet thing,' Alice went on, half to herself,\r\nas
    she swam lazily about in the pool, `and she sits purring so\r\nnicely by the
    fire, licking her paws and washing her face--and\r\nshe is such a nice soft thing
    to nurse--and she's such a capital\r\none for catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon!'
    cried Alice again,\r\nfor this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she
    felt\r\ncertain it must be really offended.  `We won't talk about her any\r\nmore
    if you'd rather not.'\r\n\r\n  `We indeed!' cried the Mouse, who was trembling
    down to the end\r\nof his tail.  `As if I would talk on such a subject!  Our
    family\r\nalways HATED cats:  nasty, low, vulgar things!  Don't let me hear\r\nthe
    name again!'\r\n\r\n  `I won't indeed!' said Alice, in a great hurry to change
    the\r\nsubject of conversation.  `Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?'\r\nThe
    Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly:  `There is\r\nsuch a nice little
    dog near our house I should like to show you!\r\nA little bright-eyed terrier,
    you know, with oh, such long curly\r\nbrown hair!  And it'll fetch things when
    you throw them, and\r\nit'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of
    things--I\r\ncan't remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer, you\r\nknow,
    and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds!\r\nHe says it kills
    all the rats and--oh dear!' cried Alice in a\r\nsorrowful tone, `I'm afraid I've
    offended it again!'  For the\r\nMouse was swimming away from her as hard as it
    could go, and\r\nmaking quite a commotion in the pool as it went.\r\n\r\n  So
    she called softly after it, `Mouse dear!  Do come back\r\nagain, and we won't
    talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't\r\nlike them!'  When the Mouse heard
    this, it turned round and swam\r\nslowly back to her:  its face was quite pale
    (with passion, Alice\r\nthought), and it said in a low trembling voice, `Let
    us get to\r\nthe shore, and then I'll tell you my history, and you'll\r\nunderstand
    why it is I hate cats and dogs.'\r\n\r\n  It was high time to go, for the pool
    was getting quite crowded\r\nwith the birds and animals that had fallen into
    it:  there were a\r\nDuck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other
    curious\r\ncreatures.  Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the\r\nshore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<align=center><size=50><color=#B22222>CHAPTER
    III</color></size></align>\r\n\r\n<align=center><size=36><color=#B22222>A Caucus-Race
    and a Long Tale</color></size></align>\r\n\r\n\r\n  They were indeed a queer-looking
    party that assembled on the\r\nbank--the birds with draggled feathers, the animals
    with their\r\nfur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and\r\nuncomfortable.\r\n\r\n 
    The first question of course was, how to get dry again:  they\r\nhad a consultation
    about this, and after a few minutes it seemed\r\nquite natural to Alice to find
    herself talking familiarly with\r\nthem, as if she had known them all her life. 
    Indeed, she had\r\nquite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky,\r\nand
    would only say, `I am older than you, and must know better';\r\nand this Alice
    would not allow without knowing how old it was,\r\nand, as the Lory positively
    refused to tell its age, there was no\r\nmore to be said.\r\n\r\n  At last the
    Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among\r\nthem, called out, `Sit
    down, all of you, and listen to me!  I'LL\r\nsoon make you dry enough!'  They
    all sat down at once, in a large\r\nring, with the Mouse in the middle.  Alice
    kept her eyes\r\nanxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad\r\ncold
    if she did not get dry very soon.\r\n\r\n  `Ahem!' said the Mouse with an important
    air, `are you all ready?\r\nThis is the driest thing I know.  Silence all round,
    if you please!\r\n\"William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope,
    was\r\nsoon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been\r\nof
    late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest.  Edwin and\r\nMorcar, the earls
    of Mercia and Northumbria--\"'\r\n\r\n  `Ugh!' said the Lory, with a shiver.\r\n\r\n 
    `I beg your pardon!' said the Mouse, frowning, but very\r\npolitely:  `Did you
    speak?'\r\n\r\n  `Not I!' said the Lory hastily.\r\n\r\n  `I thought you did,'
    said the Mouse.  `--I proceed.  \"Edwin and\r\nMorcar, the earls of Mercia and
    Northumbria, declared for him:\r\nand even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop
    of Canterbury, found\r\nit advisable--\"'\r\n\r\n  `Found WHAT?' said the Duck.\r\n\r\n 
    `Found IT,' the Mouse replied rather crossly:  `of course you\r\nknow what \"it\"
    means.'\r\n\r\n  `I know what \"it\" means well enough, when I find a thing,'
    said\r\nthe Duck:  `it's generally a frog or a worm.  The question is,\r\nwhat
    did the archbishop find?'\r\n\r\n  The Mouse did not notice this question, but
    hurriedly went on,\r\n`\"--found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet
    William\r\nand offer him the crown.  William's conduct at first was\r\nmoderate. 
    But the insolence of his Normans--\"  How are you\r\ngetting on now, my dear?'
    it continued, turning to Alice as it\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\n  `As wet as ever,' said
    Alice in a melancholy tone:  `it doesn't\r\nseem to dry me at all.'\r\n\r\n 
    `In that case,' said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, `I\r\nmove that the
    meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more\r\nenergetic remedies--'\r\n\r\n 
    `Speak English!' said the Eaglet.  `I don't know the meaning of\r\nhalf those
    long words, and, what's more, I don't believe you do\r\neither!'  And the Eaglet
    bent down its head to hide a smile:\r\nsome of the other birds tittered audibly.\r\n\r\n 
    `What I was going to say,' said the Dodo in an offended tone,\r\n`was, that the
    best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.'\r\n\r\n  `What IS a Caucus-race?'
    said Alice; not that she wanted much\r\nto know, but the Dodo had paused as if
    it thought that SOMEBODY\r\nought to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to
    say anything.\r\n\r\n  `Why,' said the Dodo, `the best way to explain it is to
    do it.'\r\n(And, as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter\r\nday,
    I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.)\r\n\r\n  First it marked out a race-course,
    in a sort of circle, (`the\r\nexact shape doesn't matter,' it said,) and then
    all the party\r\nwere placed along the course, here and there.  There was no
    `One,\r\ntwo, three, and away,' but they began running when they liked,\r\nand
    left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know\r\nwhen the race was
    over.  However, when they had been running half\r\nan hour or so, and were quite
    dry again, the Dodo suddenly called\r\nout `The race is over!' and they all crowded
    round it, panting,\r\nand asking, `But who has won?'\r\n\r\n  This question the
    Dodo could not answer without a great deal of\r\nthought, and it sat for a long
    time with one finger pressed upon\r\nits forehead (the position in which you
    usually see Shakespeare,\r\nin the pictures of him), while the rest waited in
    silence.  At\r\nlast the Dodo said, `EVERYBODY has won, and all must have\r\nprizes.'\r\n\r\n 
    `But who is to give the prizes?' quite a chorus of voices\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n 
    `Why, SHE, of course,' said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with\r\none finger; and
    the whole party at once crowded round her,\r\ncalling out in a confused way,
    `Prizes! Prizes!'\r\n\r\n  Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put
    her hand\r\nin her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt\r\nwater
    had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes.\r\nThere was exactly one
    a-piece all round.\r\n\r\n  `But she must have a prize herself, you know,' said
    the Mouse.\r\n\r\n  `Of course,' the Dodo replied very gravely.  `What else have\r\nyou
    got in your pocket?' he went on, turning to Alice.\r\n\r\n  `Only a thimble,'
    said Alice sadly.\r\n\r\n  `Hand it over here,' said the Dodo.\r\n\r\n  Then
    they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo\r\nsolemnly presented the
    thimble, saying `We beg your acceptance of\r\nthis elegant thimble'; and, when
    it had finished this short\r\nspeech, they all cheered.\r\n\r\n  Alice thought
    the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked\r\nso grave that she did not
    dare to laugh; and, as she could not\r\nthink of anything to say, she simply
    bowed, and took the thimble,\r\nlooking as solemn as she could.\r\n\r\n  The
    next thing was to eat the comfits:  this caused some noise\r\nand confusion,
    as the large birds complained that they could not\r\ntaste theirs, and the small
    ones choked and had to be patted on\r\nthe back.  However, it was over at last,
    and they sat down again\r\nin a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something
    more.\r\n\r\n  `You promised to tell me your history, you know,' said Alice,\r\n`and
    why it is you hate--C and D,' she added in a whisper, half\r\nafraid that it
    would be offended again.\r\n\r\n  `Mine is a long and a sad tale!' said the Mouse,
    turning to\r\nAlice, and sighing.\r\n\r\n  `It IS a long tail, certainly,' said
    Alice, looking down with\r\nwonder at the Mouse's tail; `but why do you call
    it sad?'  And\r\nshe kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking,
    so\r\nthat her idea of the tale was something like this:--\r\n\r\n                   
    `Fury said to a\r\n                   mouse, That he\r\n                 met
    in the\r\n               house,\r\n            \"Let us\r\n              both
    go to\r\n                law:  I will\r\n                  prosecute\r\n                   
    YOU.  --Come,\r\n                       I'll take no\r\n                       
    denial; We\r\n                     must have a\r\n                 trial:  For\r\n             
    really this\r\n           morning I've\r\n          nothing\r\n         to do.\"\r\n          
    Said the\r\n             mouse to the\r\n               cur, \"Such\r\n                
    a trial,\r\n                   dear Sir,\r\n                         With\r\n                    
    no jury\r\n                  or judge,\r\n                would be\r\n             
    wasting\r\n             our\r\n              breath.\"\r\n               \"I'll
    be\r\n                 judge, I'll\r\n                   be jury,\"\r\n                        
    Said\r\n                    cunning\r\n                      old Fury:\r\n                    
    \"I'll\r\n                      try the\r\n                         whole\r\n                         
    cause,\r\n                             and\r\n                        condemn\r\n                      
    you\r\n                      to\r\n                       death.\"'\r\n\r\n\r\n 
    `You are not attending!' said the Mouse to Alice severely.\r\n`What are you thinking
    of?'\r\n\r\n  `I beg your pardon,' said Alice very humbly:  `you had got to\r\nthe
    fifth bend, I think?'\r\n\r\n  `I had NOT!' cried the Mouse, sharply and very
    angrily.\r\n\r\n  `A knot!' said Alice, always ready to make herself useful,
    and\r\nlooking anxiously about her.  `Oh, do let me help to undo it!'\r\n\r\n 
    `I shall do nothing of the sort,' said the Mouse, getting up\r\nand walking away. 
    `You insult me by talking such nonsense!'\r\n\r\n  `I didn't mean it!' pleaded
    poor Alice.  `But you're so easily\r\noffended, you know!'\r\n\r\n  The Mouse
    only growled in reply.\r\n\r\n  `Please come back and finish your story!' Alice
    called after\r\nit; and the others all joined in chorus, `Yes, please do!' but\r\nthe
    Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little\r\nquicker.\r\n\r\n 
    `What a pity it wouldn't stay!' sighed the Lory, as soon as it\r\nwas quite out
    of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of\r\nsaying to her daughter `Ah,
    my dear!  Let this be a lesson to you\r\nnever to lose YOUR temper!'  `Hold your
    tongue, Ma!' said the\r\nyoung Crab, a little snappishly.  `You're enough to
    try the\r\npatience of an oyster!'\r\n\r\n  `I wish I had our Dinah here, I know
    I do!' said Alice aloud,\r\naddressing nobody in particular.  `She'd soon fetch
    it back!'\r\n\r\n  `And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?'\r\nsaid
    the Lory.\r\n\r\n  Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about\r\nher
    pet:  `Dinah's our cat.  And she's such a capital one for\r\ncatching mice you
    can't think!  And oh, I wish you could see her\r\nafter the birds!  Why, she'll
    eat a little bird as soon as look\r\nat it!'\r\n\r\n  This speech caused a remarkable
    sensation among the party.\r\nSome of the birds hurried off at once:  one old
    Magpie began\r\nwrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, `I really must
    be\r\ngetting home; the night-air doesn't suit my throat!' and a Canary\r\ncalled
    out in a trembling voice to its children, `Come away, my\r\ndears!  It's high
    time you were all in bed!'  On various pretexts\r\nthey all moved off, and Alice
    was soon left alone.\r\n\r\n  `I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah!' she said to
    herself in a\r\nmelancholy tone.  `Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I'm\r\nsure
    she's the best cat in the world!  Oh, my dear Dinah!  I\r\nwonder if I shall
    ever see you any more!'  And here poor Alice\r\nbegan to cry again, for she felt
    very lonely and low-spirited.\r\nIn a little while, however, she again heard
    a little pattering of\r\nfootsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly,
    half hoping\r\nthat the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to\r\nfinish
    his story."

    the Rabbit-Hole</color></size></align>\r\n\r\n  Alice was beginning to get very
    tired of sitting by her sister\r\non the bank, and of having nothing to do: 
    once or twice she had\r\npeeped into the book her sister was reading, but it
    had no\r\npictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,'\r\nthought
    Alice `without pictures or conversation?'\r\n\r\n  So she was considering in
    her own mind (as well as she could,\r\nfor the hot day made her feel very sleepy
    and stupid), whether\r\nthe pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the
    trouble\r\nof getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White\r\nRabbit
    with pink eyes ran close by her.\r\n\r\n  There was nothing so VERY remarkable
    in that; nor did Alice\r\nthink it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit
    say to\r\nitself, `Oh dear!  Oh dear!  I shall be late!'  (when she thought\r\nit
    over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have\r\nwondered at this,
    but at the time it all seemed quite natural);\r\nbut when the Rabbit actually
    TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-\r\nPOCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried
    on, Alice started to\r\nher feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had
    never\r\nbefore seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to\r\ntake
    out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the\r\nfield after it,
    and fortunately was just in time to see it pop\r\ndown a large rabbit-hole under
    the hedge.\r\n\r\n  In another moment down went Alice after it, never once\r\nconsidering
    how in the world she was to get out again.\r\n\r\n  The rabbit-hole went straight
    on like a tunnel for some way,\r\nand then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly
    that Alice had not a\r\nmoment to think about stopping herself before she found
    herself\r\nfalling down a very deep well.\r\n\r\n  Either the well was very deep,
    or she fell very slowly, for she\r\nhad plenty of time as she went down to look
    about her and to\r\nwonder what was going to happen next.  First, she tried to
    look\r\ndown and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to\r\nsee
    anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and\r\nnoticed that they
    were filled with cupboards and book-shelves;\r\nhere and there she saw maps and
    pictures hung upon pegs.  She\r\ntook down a jar from one of the shelves as she
    passed; it was\r\nlabelled `ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment
    it\r\nwas empty:  she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing\r\nsomebody,
    so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she\r\nfell past it.\r\n\r\n 
    `Well!' thought Alice to herself, `after such a fall as this, I\r\nshall think
    nothing of tumbling down stairs!  How brave they'll\r\nall think me at home! 
    Why, I wouldn't say anything about it,\r\neven if I fell off the top of the house!'
    (Which was very likely\r\ntrue.)\r\n\r\n  Down, down, down.  Would the fall NEVER
    come to an end!  `I\r\nwonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said
    aloud.\r\n`I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth.  Let\r\nme
    see:  that would be four thousand miles down, I think--' (for,\r\nyou see, Alice
    had learnt several things of this sort in her\r\nlessons in the schoolroom, and
    though this was not a VERY good\r\nopportunity for showing off her knowledge,
    as there was no one to\r\nlisten to her, still it was good practice to say it
    over) `--yes,\r\nthat's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude\r\nor
    Longitude I've got to?'  (Alice had no idea what Latitude was,\r\nor Longitude
    either, but thought they were nice grand words to\r\nsay.)\r\n\r\n  Presently
    she began again.  `I wonder if I shall fall right\r\nTHROUGH the earth!  How
    funny it'll seem to come out among the\r\npeople that walk with their heads downward! 
    The Antipathies, I\r\nthink--' (she was rather glad there WAS no one listening,
    this\r\ntime, as it didn't sound at all the right word) `--but I shall\r\nhave
    to ask them what the name of the country is, you know.\r\nPlease, Ma'am, is this
    New Zealand or Australia?' (and she tried\r\nto curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING
    as you're falling\r\nthrough the air!  Do you think you could manage it?)  `And
    what\r\nan ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking!  No, it'll\r\nnever
    do to ask:  perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'\r\n\r\n  Down, down,
    down.  There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon\r\nbegan talking again.  `Dinah'll
    miss me very much to-night, I\r\nshould think!'  (Dinah was the cat.)  `I hope
    they'll remember\r\nher saucer of milk at tea-time.  Dinah my dear!  I wish you
    were\r\ndown here with me!  There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but\r\nyou
    might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know.\r\nBut do cats eat
    bats, I wonder?'  And here Alice began to get\r\nrather sleepy, and went on saying
    to herself, in a dreamy sort of\r\nway, `Do cats eat bats?  Do cats eat bats?'
    and sometimes, `Do\r\nbats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either\r\nquestion,
    it didn't much matter which way she put it.  She felt\r\nthat she was dozing
    off, and had just begun to dream that she\r\nwas walking hand in hand with Dinah,
    and saying to her very\r\nearnestly, `Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:  did you
    ever eat a\r\nbat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of\r\nsticks
    and dry leaves, and the fall was over.\r\n\r\n  Alice was not a bit hurt, and
    she jumped up on to her feet in a\r\nmoment:  she looked up, but it was all dark
    overhead; before her\r\nwas another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still
    in\r\nsight, hurrying down it.  There was not a moment to be lost:\r\naway went
    Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it\r\nsay, as it turned a corner,
    `Oh my ears and whiskers, how late\r\nit's getting!'  She was close behind it
    when she turned the\r\ncorner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen:  she
    found\r\nherself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps\r\nhanging
    from the roof.\r\n\r\n  There were doors all round the hall, but they were all
    locked;\r\nand when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the\r\nother,
    trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle,\r\nwondering how she was
    ever to get out again.\r\n\r\n  Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged
    table, all made of\r\nsolid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden
    key,\r\nand Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the\r\ndoors
    of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or\r\nthe key was too
    small, but at any rate it would not open any of\r\nthem.  However, on the second
    time round, she came upon a low\r\ncurtain she had not noticed before, and behind
    it was a little\r\ndoor about fifteen inches high:  she tried the little golden
    key\r\nin the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!\r\n\r\n  Alice opened
    the door and found that it led into a small\r\npassage, not much larger than
    a rat-hole:  she knelt down and\r\nlooked along the passage into the loveliest
    garden you ever saw.\r\nHow she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander
    about\r\namong those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but\r\nshe
    could not even get her head through the doorway; `and even if\r\nmy head would
    go through,' thought poor Alice, `it would be of\r\nvery little use without my
    shoulders.  Oh, how I wish\r\nI could shut up like a telescope!  I think I could,
    if I only\r\nknow how to begin.'  For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things\r\nhad
    happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few\r\nthings indeed
    were really impossible.\r\n\r\n  There seemed to be no use in waiting by the
    little door, so she\r\nwent back to the table, half hoping she might find another
    key on\r\nit, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like\r\ntelescopes: 
    this time she found a little bottle on it, (`which\r\ncertainly was not here
    before,' said Alice,) and round the neck\r\nof the bottle was a paper label,
    with the words `DRINK ME'\r\nbeautifully printed on it in large letters.\r\n\r\n 
    It was all very well to say `Drink me,' but the wise little\r\nAlice was not
    going to do THAT in a hurry.  `No, I'll look\r\nfirst,' she said, `and see whether
    it's marked \"poison\" or not';\r\nfor she had read several nice little histories
    about children who\r\nhad got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant\r\nthings,
    all because they WOULD not remember the simple rules\r\ntheir friends had taught
    them:  such as, that a red-hot poker\r\nwill burn you if you hold it too long;
    and that if you cut your\r\nfinger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds;
    and she had\r\nnever forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked\r\n`poison,'
    it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n  However,
    this bottle was NOT marked `poison,' so Alice ventured\r\nto taste it, and finding
    it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort\r\nof mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard,
    pine-apple, roast\r\nturkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished\r\nit
    off.\r\n\r\n     *       *       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n        
    *       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     *       *       *      
    *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  `What a curious feeling!' said Alice; `I must
    be shutting up\r\nlike a telescope.'\r\n\r\n  And so it was indeed:  she was
    now only ten inches high, and\r\nher face brightened up at the thought that she
    was now the right\r\nsize for going through the little door into that lovely
    garden.\r\nFirst, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was\r\ngoing
    to shrink any further:  she felt a little nervous about\r\nthis; `for it might
    end, you know,' said Alice to herself, `in my\r\ngoing out altogether, like a
    candle.  I wonder what I should be\r\nlike then?'  And she tried to fancy what
    the flame of a candle is\r\nlike after the candle is blown out, for she could
    not remember\r\never having seen such a thing.\r\n\r\n  After a while, finding
    that nothing more happened, she decided\r\non going into the garden at once;
    but, alas for poor Alice!\r\nwhen she got to the door, she found she had forgotten
    the\r\nlittle golden key, and when she went back to the table for it,\r\nshe
    found she could not possibly reach it:  she could see it\r\nquite plainly through
    the glass, and she tried her best to climb\r\nup one of the legs of the table,
    but it was too slippery;\r\nand when she had tired herself out with trying,\r\nthe
    poor little thing sat down and cried.\r\n\r\n  `Come, there's no use in crying
    like that!' said Alice to\r\nherself, rather sharply; `I advise you to leave
    off this minute!'\r\nShe generally gave herself very good advice, (though she
    very\r\nseldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so\r\nseverely
    as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered\r\ntrying to box her
    own ears for having cheated herself in a game\r\nof croquet she was playing against
    herself, for this curious\r\nchild was very fond of pretending to be two people. 
    `But it's no\r\nuse now,' thought poor Alice, `to pretend to be two people! 
    Why,\r\nthere's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable\r\nperson!'\r\n\r\n 
    Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under\r\nthe table:  she
    opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on\r\nwhich the words `EAT ME'
    were beautifully marked in currants.\r\n`Well, I'll eat it,' said Alice, `and
    if it makes me grow larger,\r\nI can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller,
    I can creep\r\nunder the door; so either way I'll get into the garden, and I\r\ndon't
    care which happens!'\r\n\r\n  She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself,
    `Which\r\nway?  Which way?', holding her hand on the top of her head to\r\nfeel
    which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to\r\nfind that she remained
    the same size:  to be sure, this generally\r\nhappens when one eats cake, but
    Alice had got so much into the\r\nway of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way
    things to happen,\r\nthat it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in
    the\r\ncommon way.\r\n\r\n  So she set to work, and very soon finished off the
    cake.\r\n\r\n     *       *       *       *       *       *       *\r\n        
    *       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<align=center><size=50><color=#B22222>CHAPTER
    II</color></size></align>\r\n\r\n<align=center><size=36><color=#B22222>The Pool
    of Tears</color></size></align>\r\n\r\n\r\n  `Curiouser and curiouser!' cried
    Alice (she was so much\r\nsurprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how
    to speak good\r\nEnglish); `now I'm opening out like the largest telescope that\r\never
    was!  Good-bye, feet!' (for when she looked down at her\r\nfeet, they seemed
    to be almost out of sight, they were getting so\r\nfar off).  `Oh, my poor little
    feet, I wonder who will put on\r\nyour shoes and stockings for you now, dears? 
    I'm sure _I_ shan't\r\nbe able!  I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble
    myself\r\nabout you:  you must manage the best way you can; --but I must be\r\nkind
    to them,' thought Alice, `or perhaps they won't walk the\r\nway I want to go! 
    Let me see:  I'll give them a new pair of\r\nboots every Christmas.'\r\n\r\n 
    And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it.\r\n`They must go
    by the carrier,' she thought; `and how funny it'll\r\nseem, sending presents
    to one's own feet!  And how odd the\r\ndirections will look!\r\n\r\n           
    ALICE'S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ.\r\n                HEARTHRUG,\r\n                   
    NEAR THE FENDER,\r\n                        (WITH ALICE'S LOVE).\r\n\r\nOh dear,
    what nonsense I'm talking!'\r\n\r\n  Just then her head struck against the roof
    of the hall:  in\r\nfact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once
    took\r\nup the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.\r\n\r\n 
    Poor Alice!  It was as much as she could do, lying down on one\r\nside, to look
    through into the garden with one eye; but to get\r\nthrough was more hopeless
    than ever:  she sat down and began to\r\ncry again.\r\n\r\n  `You ought to be
    ashamed of yourself,' said Alice, `a great\r\ngirl like you,' (she might well
    say this), `to go on crying in\r\nthis way!  Stop this moment, I tell you!' 
    But she went on all\r\nthe same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a
    large pool\r\nall round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the\r\nhall.\r\n\r\n 
    After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the\r\ndistance, and she
    hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming.\r\nIt was the White Rabbit returning,
    splendidly dressed, with a\r\npair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large
    fan in the\r\nother:  he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to\r\nhimself
    as he came, `Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won't she\r\nbe savage if I've
    kept her waiting!'  Alice felt so desperate\r\nthat she was ready to ask help
    of any one; so, when the Rabbit\r\ncame near her, she began, in a low, timid
    voice, `If you please,\r\nsir--'  The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white
    kid\r\ngloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard\r\nas
    he could go.\r\n\r\n  Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was
    very\r\nhot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking:\r\n`Dear,
    dear!  How queer everything is to-day!  And yesterday\r\nthings went on just
    as usual.  I wonder if I've been changed in\r\nthe night?  Let me think:  was
    I the same when I got up this\r\nmorning?  I almost think I can remember feeling
    a little\r\ndifferent.  But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Who in\r\nthe
    world am I?  Ah, THAT'S the great puzzle!'  And she began\r\nthinking over all
    the children she knew that were of the same age\r\nas herself, to see if she
    could have been changed for any of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n  `I'm sure I'm not Ada,'
    she said, `for her hair goes in such\r\nlong ringlets, and mine doesn't go in
    ringlets at all; and I'm\r\nsure I can't be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things,
    and she,\r\noh! she knows such a very little!  Besides, SHE'S she, and I'm I,\r\nand--oh
    dear, how puzzling it all is!  I'll try if I know all the\r\nthings I used to
    know.  Let me see:  four times five is twelve,\r\nand four times six is thirteen,
    and four times seven is--oh dear!\r\nI shall never get to twenty at that rate! 
    However, the\r\nMultiplication Table doesn't signify:  let's try Geography.\r\nLondon
    is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome,\r\nand Rome--no, THAT'S
    all wrong, I'm certain!  I must have been\r\nchanged for Mabel!  I'll try and
    say \"How doth the little--\"'\r\nand she crossed her hands on her lap as if
    she were saying lessons,\r\nand began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse
    and\r\nstrange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:--\r\n\r\n           
    `How doth the little crocodile\r\n              Improve his shining tail,\r\n           
    And pour the waters of the Nile\r\n              On every golden scale!\r\n\r\n           
    `How cheerfully he seems to grin,\r\n              How neatly spread his claws,\r\n           
    And welcome little fishes in\r\n              With gently smiling jaws!'\r\n\r\n 
    `I'm sure those are not the right words,' said poor Alice, and\r\nher eyes filled
    with tears again as she went on, `I must be Mabel\r\nafter all, and I shall have
    to go and live in that poky little\r\nhouse, and have next to no toys to play
    with, and oh! ever so\r\nmany lessons to learn!  No, I've made up my mind about
    it; if I'm\r\nMabel, I'll stay down here!  It'll be no use their putting their\r\nheads
    down and saying \"Come up again, dear!\"  I shall only look\r\nup and say \"Who
    am I then?  Tell me that first, and then, if I\r\nlike being that person, I'll
    come up:  if not, I'll stay down\r\nhere till I'm somebody else\"--but, oh dear!'
    cried Alice, with a\r\nsudden burst of tears, `I do wish they WOULD put their
    heads\r\ndown!  I am so VERY tired of being all alone here!'\r\n\r\n  As she
    said this she looked down at her hands, and was\r\nsurprised to see that she
    had put on one of the Rabbit's little\r\nwhite kid gloves while she was talking. 
    `How CAN I have done\r\nthat?' she thought.  `I must be growing small again.' 
    She got up\r\nand went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that,\r\nas
    nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high,\r\nand was going
    on shrinking rapidly:  she soon found out that the\r\ncause of this was the fan
    she was holding, and she dropped it\r\nhastily, just in time to avoid shrinking
    away altogether.\r\n\r\n`That WAS a narrow escape!' said Alice, a good deal frightened
    at\r\nthe sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in\r\nexistence;
    `and now for the garden!' and she ran with all speed\r\nback to the little door: 
    but, alas! the little door was shut\r\nagain, and the little golden key was lying
    on the glass table as\r\nbefore, `and things are worse than ever,' thought the
    poor child,\r\n`for I never was so small as this before, never!  And I declare\r\nit's
    too bad, that it is!'\r\n\r\n  As she said these words her foot slipped, and
    in another\r\nmoment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt water.  Her first\r\nidea
    was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, `and in that\r\ncase I can go back
    by railway,' she said to herself.  (Alice had\r\nbeen to the seaside once in
    her life, and had come to the general\r\nconclusion, that wherever you go to
    on the English coast you find\r\na number of bathing machines in the sea, some
    children digging in\r\nthe sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses,
    and\r\nbehind them a railway station.)  However, she soon made out that\r\nshe
    was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine\r\nfeet high.\r\n\r\n 
    `I wish I hadn't cried so much!' said Alice, as she swam about,\r\ntrying to
    find her way out.  `I shall be punished for it now, I\r\nsuppose, by being drowned
    in my own tears!  That WILL be a queer\r\nthing, to be sure!  However, everything
    is queer to-day.'\r\n\r\n  Just then she heard something splashing about in the
    pool a\r\nlittle way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was:  at\r\nfirst
    she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then\r\nshe remembered how
    small she was now, and she soon made out that\r\nit was only a mouse that had
    slipped in like herself.\r\n\r\n  `Would it be of any use, now,' thought Alice,
    `to speak to this\r\nmouse?  Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that
    I should\r\nthink very likely it can talk:  at any rate, there's no harm in\r\ntrying.' 
    So she began:  `O Mouse, do you know the way out of\r\nthis pool?  I am very
    tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!'\r\n(Alice thought this must be the right
    way of speaking to a mouse:\r\nshe had never done such a thing before, but she
    remembered having\r\nseen in her brother's Latin Grammar, `A mouse--of a mouse--to
    a\r\nmouse--a mouse--O mouse!')  The Mouse looked at her rather\r\ninquisitively,
    and seemed to her to wink with one of its little\r\neyes, but it said nothing.\r\n\r\n 
    `Perhaps it doesn't understand English,' thought Alice; `I\r\ndaresay it's a
    French mouse, come over with William the\r\nConqueror.'  (For, with all her knowledge
    of history, Alice had\r\nno very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.) 
    So she\r\nbegan again:  `Ou est ma chatte?' which was the first sentence in\r\nher
    French lesson-book.  The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the\r\nwater, and seemed
    to quiver all over with fright.  `Oh, I beg\r\nyour pardon!' cried Alice hastily,
    afraid that she had hurt the\r\npoor animal's feelings.  `I quite forgot you
    didn't like cats.'\r\n\r\n  `Not like cats!' cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate\r\nvoice. 
    `Would YOU like cats if you were me?'\r\n\r\n  `Well, perhaps not,' said Alice
    in a soothing tone:  `don't be\r\nangry about it.  And yet I wish I could show
    you our cat Dinah:\r\nI think you'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see
    her.\r\nShe is such a dear quiet thing,' Alice went on, half to herself,\r\nas
    she swam lazily about in the pool, `and she sits purring so\r\nnicely by the
    fire, licking her paws and washing her face--and\r\nshe is such a nice soft thing
    to nurse--and she's such a capital\r\none for catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon!'
    cried Alice again,\r\nfor this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she
    felt\r\ncertain it must be really offended.  `We won't talk about her any\r\nmore
    if you'd rather not.'\r\n\r\n  `We indeed!' cried the Mouse, who was trembling
    down to the end\r\nof his tail.  `As if I would talk on such a subject!  Our
    family\r\nalways HATED cats:  nasty, low, vulgar things!  Don't let me hear\r\nthe
    name again!'\r\n\r\n  `I won't indeed!' said Alice, in a great hurry to change
    the\r\nsubject of conversation.  `Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?'\r\nThe
    Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly:  `There is\r\nsuch a nice little
    dog near our house I should like to show you!\r\nA little bright-eyed terrier,
    you know, with oh, such long curly\r\nbrown hair!  And it'll fetch things when
    you throw them, and\r\nit'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of
    things--I\r\ncan't remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer, you\r\nknow,
    and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds!\r\nHe says it kills
    all the rats and--oh dear!' cried Alice in a\r\nsorrowful tone, `I'm afraid I've
    offended it again!'  For the\r\nMouse was swimming away from her as hard as it
    could go, and\r\nmaking quite a commotion in the pool as it went.\r\n\r\n  So
    she called softly after it, `Mouse dear!  Do come back\r\nagain, and we won't
    talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't\r\nlike them!'  When the Mouse heard
    this, it turned round and swam\r\nslowly back to her:  its face was quite pale
    (with passion, Alice\r\nthought), and it said in a low trembling voice, `Let
    us get to\r\nthe shore, and then I'll tell you my history, and you'll\r\nunderstand
    why it is I hate cats and dogs.'\r\n\r\n  It was high time to go, for the pool
    was getting quite crowded\r\nwith the birds and animals that had fallen into
    it:  there were a\r\nDuck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other
    curious\r\ncreatures.  Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the\r\nshore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<align=center><size=50><color=#B22222>CHAPTER
    III</color></size></align>\r\n\r\n<align=center><size=36><color=#B22222>A Caucus-Race
    and a Long Tale</color></size></align>\r\n\r\n\r\n  They were indeed a queer-looking
    party that assembled on the\r\nbank--the birds with draggled feathers, the animals
    with their\r\nfur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and\r\nuncomfortable.\r\n\r\n 
    The first question of course was, how to get dry again:  they\r\nhad a consultation
    about this, and after a few minutes it seemed\r\nquite natural to Alice to find
    herself talking familiarly with\r\nthem, as if she had known them all her life. 
    Indeed, she had\r\nquite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky,\r\nand
    would only say, `I am older than you, and must know better';\r\nand this Alice
    would not allow without knowing how old it was,\r\nand, as the Lory positively
    refused to tell its age, there was no\r\nmore to be said.\r\n\r\n  At last the
    Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among\r\nthem, called out, `Sit
    down, all of you, and listen to me!  I'LL\r\nsoon make you dry enough!'  They
    all sat down at once, in a large\r\nring, with the Mouse in the middle.  Alice
    kept her eyes\r\nanxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad\r\ncold
    if she did not get dry very soon.\r\n\r\n  `Ahem!' said the Mouse with an important
    air, `are you all ready?\r\nThis is the driest thing I know.  Silence all round,
    if you please!\r\n\"William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope,
    was\r\nsoon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been\r\nof
    late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest.  Edwin and\r\nMorcar, the earls
    of Mercia and Northumbria--\"'\r\n\r\n  `Ugh!' said the Lory, with a shiver.\r\n\r\n 
    `I beg your pardon!' said the Mouse, frowning, but very\r\npolitely:  `Did you
    speak?'\r\n\r\n  `Not I!' said the Lory hastily.\r\n\r\n  `I thought you did,'
    said the Mouse.  `--I proceed.  \"Edwin and\r\nMorcar, the earls of Mercia and
    Northumbria, declared for him:\r\nand even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop
    of Canterbury, found\r\nit advisable--\"'\r\n\r\n  `Found WHAT?' said the Duck.\r\n\r\n 
    `Found IT,' the Mouse replied rather crossly:  `of course you\r\nknow what \"it\"
    means.'\r\n\r\n  `I know what \"it\" means well enough, when I find a thing,'
    said\r\nthe Duck:  `it's generally a frog or a worm.  The question is,\r\nwhat
    did the archbishop find?'\r\n\r\n  The Mouse did not notice this question, but
    hurriedly went on,\r\n`\"--found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet
    William\r\nand offer him the crown.  William's conduct at first was\r\nmoderate. 
    But the insolence of his Normans--\"  How are you\r\ngetting on now, my dear?'
    it continued, turning to Alice as it\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\n  `As wet as ever,' said
    Alice in a melancholy tone:  `it doesn't\r\nseem to dry me at all.'\r\n\r\n 
    `In that case,' said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, `I\r\nmove that the
    meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more\r\nenergetic remedies--'\r\n\r\n 
    `Speak English!' said the Eaglet.  `I don't know the meaning of\r\nhalf those
    long words, and, what's more, I don't believe you do\r\neither!'  And the Eaglet
    bent down its head to hide a smile:\r\nsome of the other birds tittered audibly.\r\n\r\n 
    `What I was going to say,' said the Dodo in an offended tone,\r\n`was, that the
    best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.'\r\n\r\n  `What IS a Caucus-race?'
    said Alice; not that she wanted much\r\nto know, but the Dodo had paused as if
    it thought that SOMEBODY\r\nought to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to
    say anything.\r\n\r\n  `Why,' said the Dodo, `the best way to explain it is to
    do it.'\r\n(And, as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter\r\nday,
    I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.)\r\n\r\n  First it marked out a race-course,
    in a sort of circle, (`the\r\nexact shape doesn't matter,' it said,) and then
    all the party\r\nwere placed along the course, here and there.  There was no
    `One,\r\ntwo, three, and away,' but they began running when they liked,\r\nand
    left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know\r\nwhen the race was
    over.  However, when they had been running half\r\nan hour or so, and were quite
    dry again, the Dodo suddenly called\r\nout `The race is over!' and they all crowded
    round it, panting,\r\nand asking, `But who has won?'\r\n\r\n  This question the
    Dodo could not answer without a great deal of\r\nthought, and it sat for a long
    time with one finger pressed upon\r\nits forehead (the position in which you
    usually see Shakespeare,\r\nin the pictures of him), while the rest waited in
    silence.  At\r\nlast the Dodo said, `EVERYBODY has won, and all must have\r\nprizes.'\r\n\r\n 
    `But who is to give the prizes?' quite a chorus of voices\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n 
    `Why, SHE, of course,' said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with\r\none finger; and
    the whole party at once crowded round her,\r\ncalling out in a confused way,
    `Prizes! Prizes!'\r\n\r\n  Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put
    her hand\r\nin her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt\r\nwater
    had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes.\r\nThere was exactly one
    a-piece all round.\r\n\r\n  `But she must have a prize herself, you know,' said
    the Mouse.\r\n\r\n  `Of course,' the Dodo replied very gravely.  `What else have\r\nyou
    got in your pocket?' he went on, turning to Alice.\r\n\r\n  `Only a thimble,'
    said Alice sadly.\r\n\r\n  `Hand it over here,' said the Dodo.\r\n\r\n  Then
    they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo\r\nsolemnly presented the
    thimble, saying `We beg your acceptance of\r\nthis elegant thimble'; and, when
    it had finished this short\r\nspeech, they all cheered.\r\n\r\n  Alice thought
    the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked\r\nso grave that she did not
    dare to laugh; and, as she could not\r\nthink of anything to say, she simply
    bowed, and took the thimble,\r\nlooking as solemn as she could.\r\n\r\n  The
    next thing was to eat the comfits:  this caused some noise\r\nand confusion,
    as the large birds complained that they could not\r\ntaste theirs, and the small
    ones choked and had to be patted on\r\nthe back.  However, it was over at last,
    and they sat down again\r\nin a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something
    more.\r\n\r\n  `You promised to tell me your history, you know,' said Alice,\r\n`and
    why it is you hate--C and D,' she added in a whisper, half\r\nafraid that it
    would be offended again.\r\n\r\n  `Mine is a long and a sad tale!' said the Mouse,
    turning to\r\nAlice, and sighing.\r\n\r\n  `It IS a long tail, certainly,' said
    Alice, looking down with\r\nwonder at the Mouse's tail; `but why do you call
    it sad?'  And\r\nshe kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking,
    so\r\nthat her idea of the tale was something like this:--\r\n\r\n                   
    `Fury said to a\r\n                   mouse, That he\r\n                 met
    in the\r\n               house,\r\n            \"Let us\r\n              both
    go to\r\n                law:  I will\r\n                  prosecute\r\n                   
    YOU.  --Come,\r\n                       I'll take no\r\n                       
    denial; We\r\n                     must have a\r\n                 trial:  For\r\n             
    really this\r\n           morning I've\r\n          nothing\r\n         to do.\"\r\n          
    Said the\r\n             mouse to the\r\n               cur, \"Such\r\n                
    a trial,\r\n                   dear Sir,\r\n                         With\r\n                    
    no jury\r\n                  or judge,\r\n                would be\r\n             
    wasting\r\n             our\r\n              breath.\"\r\n               \"I'll
    be\r\n                 judge, I'll\r\n                   be jury,\"\r\n                        
    Said\r\n                    cunning\r\n                      old Fury:\r\n                    
    \"I'll\r\n                      try the\r\n                         whole\r\n                         
    cause,\r\n                             and\r\n                        condemn\r\n                      
    you\r\n                      to\r\n                       death.\"'\r\n\r\n\r\n 
    `You are not attending!' said the Mouse to Alice severely.\r\n`What are you thinking
    of?'\r\n\r\n  `I beg your pardon,' said Alice very humbly:  `you had got to\r\nthe
    fifth bend, I think?'\r\n\r\n  `I had NOT!' cried the Mouse, sharply and very
    angrily.\r\n\r\n  `A knot!' said Alice, always ready to make herself useful,
    and\r\nlooking anxiously about her.  `Oh, do let me help to undo it!'\r\n\r\n 
    `I shall do nothing of the sort,' said the Mouse, getting up\r\nand walking away. 
    `You insult me by talking such nonsense!'\r\n\r\n  `I didn't mean it!' pleaded
    poor Alice.  `But you're so easily\r\noffended, you know!'\r\n\r\n  The Mouse
    only growled in reply.\r\n\r\n  `Please come back and finish your story!' Alice
    called after\r\nit; and the others all joined in chorus, `Yes, please do!' but\r\nthe
    Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little\r\nquicker.\r\n\r\n 
    `What a pity it wouldn't stay!' sighed the Lory, as soon as it\r\nwas quite out
    of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of\r\nsaying to her daughter `Ah,
    my dear!  Let this be a lesson to you\r\nnever to lose YOUR temper!'  `Hold your
    tongue, Ma!' said the\r\nyoung Crab, a little snappishly.  `You're enough to
    try the\r\npatience of an oyster!'\r\n\r\n  `I wish I had our Dinah here, I know
    I do!' said Alice aloud,\r\naddressing nobody in particular.  `She'd soon fetch
    it back!'\r\n\r\n  `And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?'\r\nsaid
    the Lory.\r\n\r\n  Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about\r\nher
    pet:  `Dinah's our cat.  And she's such a capital one for\r\ncatching mice you
    can't think!  And oh, I wish you could see her\r\nafter the birds!  Why, she'll
    eat a little bird as soon as look\r\nat it!'\r\n\r\n  This speech caused a remarkable
    sensation among the party.\r\nSome of the birds hurried off at once:  one old
    Magpie began\r\nwrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, `I really must
    be\r\ngetting home; the night-air doesn't suit my throat!' and a Canary\r\ncalled
    out in a trembling voice to its children, `Come away, my\r\ndears!  It's high
    time you were all in bed!'  On various pretexts\r\nthey all moved off, and Alice
    was soon left alone.\r\n\r\n  `I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah!' she said to
    herself in a\r\nmelancholy tone.  `Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I'm\r\nsure
    she's the best cat in the world!  Oh, my dear Dinah!  I\r\nwonder if I shall
    ever see you any more!'  And here poor Alice\r\nbegan to cry again, for she felt
    very lonely and low-spirited.\r\nIn a little while, however, she again heard
    a little pattering of\r\nfootsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly,
    half hoping\r\nthat the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to\r\nfinish
    his story."
